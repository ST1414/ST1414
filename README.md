## About Me

Hey There,

After spending more than a **decade** in **technology consulting** where my role spanned everything from junior software developer, to system deployment lead, to program manager ... I decided to pivot back to **software engineering** which is where I found the most **fulfilling** work.  

## Fun Facts
- I spent 15+ years in consulting and 10 of years working on the digital transformation of the built environment
- Two of my first three roles in consulting were as a developer (Java, SAP ABAP)
- I recently spent 6 months in a full stack software engineering bootcamp learning JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js and more
- When I'm not coding, I'm a hustling father of 3
