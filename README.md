## About Me

Hey There,

After spending more than a **decade** in **technology consulting** where my role spanned everything from junior software developer, to system deployment lead, to program manager ... I decided to pivot back to **software engineering** which is where I found the most **fulfilling** work.  

## Fun Facts
- I spent 10 years working on the digital transformation of the built environment
- I split time between Washington, DC and Munich, Germany over a 2 year period
- My first consulting role was a Java developer; my third consulting role was as SAP ABAP developer
- I recently spent 6 months in a full stack software engineering bootcamp learning JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js and more
- I'm currently running through algorithms via Code Signal and Leet Code
- When I'm not coding, I'm a hustling father of 3
